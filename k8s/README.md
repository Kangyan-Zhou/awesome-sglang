# Production Deployment

In production deployments, features like EAGLE 3, function calling, JSON mode, reasoning parser, metrics, and crash dump are typically enabled to improve performance, reliability, and observability. The EAGLE 3 training pipeline is powered by [SpecForge](https://github.com/sgl-project/SpecForge)➚, and for Kubernetes orchestration, we recommend [OME](https://github.com/sgl-project/ome)—a production-ready framework designed for scalable LLM serving.
