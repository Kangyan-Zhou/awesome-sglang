# SGLang Cookbook

SGLang offers a wide array of configuration parameters. This manual provides detailed coverage, but what users often need is a straightforward, ready-to-use setup that delivers strong performance, particularly when low latency is essential. The cookbook aim to anwser the question: **How do i benchmark model X in hardware Y?**

SGLang's official model releases typically focus on H100 and B200 GPUs. However, the completeness of this cookbook relies on the open source community. We welcome contributions that extend support beyond these hardware specifications. Contributors can follow the format for existing modes, please also attach benchmarks results using our unified benchmark framework [genai-bench](https://github.com/sgl-project/genai-bench)âžš
